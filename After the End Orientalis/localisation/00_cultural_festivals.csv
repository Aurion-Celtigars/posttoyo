EVTDESC_jp_4;The Obon Festival begins as a musician calls from the top of a wooden Yagura, calling everyone to to the Bon Odori. Without further due, all will line around the tower, dancing the traditional dances and songs of their home prefectures to welcome the spirits of their ancestors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_jp_4;I think I'll sit this one out...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

hanami_festival;Preparations for the Hanami Festival begin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_jp_9;As the spring dews arrive you watch in awe to a magnificent display of cherry blossoms bursting from their buds before you. Your court decides to spend a leisurely week strolling your realms lively array of flowers floating in the cool air.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_jp9;Sakura, sakura! Carry me in the winds...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_jp_10;You and your entourage arrive at a local outcropping surrounded by the sakura trees whose petals dance above you to the breeze. Your servants prepare for you a fine picnic as you sit beneath a tree contemplating on the calming breeze of nature that surrounds you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_jp_10;I'll spend this time to reminiscence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_jp_10;...a haiku about the fragility of nature will do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_jp_11;A servant pulls out a shakuhachi and gently serenades the entourage late into the night as lanterns illuminate the trees in a brilliant dance of light. Around you the soft murmurs of passerbys melt away in the wind as you reflect on your time outside the palace.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_jp_11;What a beautiful night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_jp_12;The Hanami Festival comes to a close, as you return to your courtly affairs you reflect on your brief recess.

EVTOPTA_jp_12;A most wonderous sight, indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
