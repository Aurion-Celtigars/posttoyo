atomicist;Atomicist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Through cunning and trickery however, the twin demons sowed chaos and corrupted the warriors of light, bring down everything which the Leader had so long built.

As they took the final plunge the old world laid in a dark ashen abyss but from that void the gleaming brilliance of the Supreme Leader was reborn again as the Eternal Sun and the guardian spirits as the stars.

hindu;Sanatani;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hindu_DESC;Sanatan Dharma, commonly known as Hinduism has a multiplicity of forms that regard each other as somewhat valid variations of the tradition, valuing the four goals of life - Kama, Arth, Dharma, and Moksha - as well as sacred texts based down from the ancient sages.

tirthaist;Tirthaist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tirthaist_DESC;Hinduism reached Indonesia thousands of years ago, merging into the local religions and solidifying itself as the most popular religion in the region.  After the rise of Islam it was restricted to a few small areas. Dominated by Islam, the already unique and idiosyncratic practices of the Balinese Hindus become more sharply influenced by Islamic doctrine, and more specifically the monotheism that was required of them. All gods are emanations of Sang Hyang Widhi Wasa The Great Cosmic Order, however the most important is Siwa, who is seen as the chief manifestation of the God and ruler over all. Second to him is his "little brother" Buddha, who governs a separate class of priests. Subject to Siwa are the 4 other chief gods, Mahadewa, Iswara, Brahma, and Wisnu as well as his wife, Uma.  The elaborate cosmology of Balinese Hinduism is less important to the practice than the daily rituals, many of which center on the use of holy water and the practice of sacrifices to appease both the gods of Dharma and the demons of Adharma. These sacrifices are performed by the Pedandas of both Siwa and Buddha and are accompanied by a litany from a lontar manuscript. Many of these sacrifices are dedicated to the Kanda Mpat,the five spirits that are born with every person, representing Siwa and his subject gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
