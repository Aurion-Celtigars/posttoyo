mandala_government_desc;The mandala system of state relations arose long ago with the arrival of Indian traders in Southeast Asia and has returned in more recent centuries. Courtly and ritual extravagance -- which is funded by a vast and complex trade network -- plays a crucial role in the conception of the mandala. The hegemonic king is the center of the mandala with their spiritual and political authority radiating from their capital. The understanding between ruler and subject is less rigidly hierarchical than other forms of government. The subject enjoys greater autonomy and their fealty is to an individual ruler rather than a realm, and as a result hegemonies both rise and fall with ease.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
