mandala_government;Mandala;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mandala_government_desc;The mandala system of state relations arose long ago with the arrival of Indian traders in Southeast Asia and has returned in more recent centuries. Courtly and ritual extravagance -- which is funded by a vast and complex trade network -- plays a crucial role in the conception of the mandala. The hegemonic king is the center of the mandala with their spiritual and political authority radiating from their capital. The understanding between ruler and subject is less rigidly hierarchical than other forms of government. The subject enjoys greater autonomy and their fealty is to an individual ruler rather than a realm, and as a result hegemonies both rise and fall with ease.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

malaysian_confederacy;Malaysian Federation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
malaysian_confederacy_desc;The government of the Malaysian Federation is inspired by the Constitution of pre-Event Malaysia, or rather what little is still remembered. Under this form of government, the right for a lord to practice their own faith free of interference from others is enshrined by law. Instead, nobles are encouraged to set aside their differences and instead work towards unity driven by an identity that transcends religion. An overlord cannot infringe on their vassals on the basis of their faith, and opinion penalties based on religious differences are reduced. Also enshrined is the ideal of "democracy", the right for the kings of the land to elect their first among equals. In return, however, the lords of the land have the obligation to help defend the Federation in times of crisis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
