celebrate_ashura;Commemorate Ashura;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
celebrate_ashura_desc;Ashura commemorates the martyrdom of Hussayn ibn Ali, grandson of the Prophet, in a battle against the tyrannical Caliph Yazid on the plains of Karbala. Ashura is one of the most important holy days in Shia Islam, and its commemmoration among the faithful has survived until the present day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ashura_decision;You begin commemmorating Ashura.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ashura_timer;Recently Commemmorated Ashura;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ashura_1;The month of Muharram approaches - and with it, the solemn reminder of Ashura. The revolution of the third Imam, Hussayn, Alayhi Salam, will not be forgotten and will not go in vain. The struggle on Karbala's plain has ignited a flame that will forever remain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ashura_1;Labayka ya Hussayn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_ashura_begins;You begin commemmorating Ashura.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ashura_2;The anniversary of the first day of the battle in Karbala has arrived, and with it, mourners in black flock the streets. As you watch a Taziya reenactment of the battle, you contemplate to yourself the virtue of righteous resistance. The Imam was truly brave to fight against the tyrant of his time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ashura_2;Death with dignity is better than life with humiliation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ashura_2;Better to live and fight another day, in my opinion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ashura_3;Soon after the events at Karbala, a curious tradition of self-flagellation, or Tatbir, grew among some more zealous Shi'a. A theological debate has broken out before you, as scholars argue whether or not Tatbir is permissible - self-damage is usually considered haram, but some stubbornly adhere to the tradition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ashura_3;I will join the mourners myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ashura_3;Tatbir is a problematic practice, and so I must ban it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ashura_4;On this ninth day, several prominent events occurred - the Tyrant's army besieged the Imam and his companions in Karbala, and preparations for battle were made. Many of the faithful go to Mosques and engage in charity - perhaps you should, as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ashura_4;Make it so - distribute alms to the poor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ashura_4;I am indisposed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ashura_5;The tenth day of Muharram is here, and commemoration reaches a high point. On this day, the Imam, most of his family, and all of his companions were martyred by the forces of The Tyrant. Though the sacrifice at Karbala happened long ago, its lessons are learned from even to this day. Your thoughts are interrupted by a large shout, as the crowd chants "Ya Hussayn!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ashura_5;Every day is Ashura, every land is Karbala.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ashura_6;It has been forty days since the commemoration of Ashura. Traditionally, many would make a pilgrimage to the shrine of the Imam, but as this is unfeasible, many of the devout choose to fast on this day in final commemoration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ashura_6;I will join the fast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ashura_6;I do not think that is necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ashura_6;I cannot fast - I am at war!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ashura_7;Unfortunately, war has come to your realm in the middle of Ashura. All commemmorations must cease immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
