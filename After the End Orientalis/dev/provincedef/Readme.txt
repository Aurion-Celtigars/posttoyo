Dongbei 
	- only Jilin were defined with map file's color. Most provinces still lack barony names and number of holding.
	- colorcheck column are added to quickly check if there are duplicate rgb anywhere. It tend to happen with copy-paste.
	- 11 out of maybe 32 counties in Liaoning is named and paired with rgb.
	- Heilongjiang is undefined, and current amount of counties are way too few.
		(I consider redraw it sometimes in the future, and preferably define it at the same time, or I will forgot most details by next month :S)
